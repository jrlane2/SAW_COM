# SAW_COM
Coupling of Modes analysis for SAW devices

A simple set of functions for implemententing solutions to the coupling of modes (COM) equations for modeling surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. Includes a P-matrix data type, a function that generates a P-matrix for general solutions to the COM equations, and a function for concatenating P-matrices.
